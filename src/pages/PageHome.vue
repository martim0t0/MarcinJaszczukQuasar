            Figuring Stuff Out
          </p>
          <p>
            Hey, welcome to my home page! Itâ€™s kind of a digital journal that contains things I like to figure out. Life is about figuring things out and you're allowed to have fun doing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything on this website is created by me from scratch. Every image here, every line of code, and every thought. I put a lot of work into learning how to do all of this stuff, so I hope you enjoy it!

        <p>One of my favorite events is an airshow and I always have my Sony mirrorless camera!</p>
        <p>When I'm not figuring out how to take pictures, I'm figuring out how to draw things digitally or create programs.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite technologies are Linux, Vue.js, Python, and SQL. Lately, I've been quite interested in how networks operate and trying to figure out TCP/IP.</p>

            Direction of this site
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, this site is just a static blog. I'm using it as a testing ground for what I can get away with at zero monetary cost to me. So far, this site has only cost the purchase of the www.marcinjaszczuk.win domain name at $11.99 for five years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next things that will be added to this site will be an administrator page for blog posts and a user authentication system so that people can leave comments.
